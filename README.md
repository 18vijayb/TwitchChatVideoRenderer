# TwitchChatVideoRenderer

Hello! Thanks for checking out this repository.

The code will generate an equivalent video of twitch chat, with emotes and all. All it requires is a twitch json file, which can be downloaded with TCD.

I would develop this repo more, however it is currently part of a much bigger project! This is just part of a codebase that I worked on and I am proud to share.

Please message me with any questions and I will be glad to help out.

Thanks again :)
