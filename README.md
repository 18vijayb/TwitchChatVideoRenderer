# TwitchChatVideoRenderer

Hello! Thanks for checking out this repository. Hopefully you are reading hti

The code will generate an equivalent video of twitch chat, with emotes and all. All it requires is a twitch json file, which can be downloaded with TCD.

I would develop this repo more, however it is currently part of a much bigger project! That repository is private, but I would be glad to share details as I am able. Just ask. 

Anyway, this is just part of a codebase that I worked on and I am proud to share.

Please message me with any questions and I will be glad to help out.

Thanks again :)
