# TwitchChatVideoRenderer

What: This repository downloads twitch chat to a video file

TCD: https://github.com/PetterKraabol/Twitch-Chat-Downloader

How to use (only linux machines):
1. [Install FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). I prefer using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Simple `brew install ffmpeg`
2. Install the dependencies in requirements.txt

The code will generate an equivalent video of twitch chat, with emotes and all. All it requires is a twitch json file, which can be downloaded with TCD.

Anyway, this is just part of a codebase that I worked on and I am proud to share. Reach out to me for demo videos and I will be more than glad to share them with you.

Please message me with any questions with questions otherwise.

Thanks again :)
